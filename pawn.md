# PAWN

PAWN is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) algorithm [^1]. Unlike variance based GSA approaches, it considers the entire distribution (specifically the CDF) of the model output. I have implemented PAWN and the first example discussed in [^1] in MATLAB. The latest code can be downloaded off the [MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69436-pawn-global-sensitivity-analysis-algorithm). (It is also available on my Github at <https://www.github.com/sriki18/pawn>).

The first example discussed in [^1] is the sensitivity of the Ishigami-Homma function. I have included the code for this in `ishigami_homma.m` and also included the code to reproduce Fig. 4 from [^1]. Below is the figure I reproduced (the original is [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215000237#fig4)):

## Additional information

The original authors of the PAWN paper maintain a website which provides the [code for PAWN](https://www.safetoolbox.info/pawn-method/) and additionally a [cool sensitivity analysis toolbox](https://www.safetoolbox.info/info-and-documentation/) for MATLAB called `SAFE Toolbox`.
