title: PAWN

PAWN is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) algorithm [^1]. Unlike variance based GSA approaches, it considers the entire distribution (specifically the CDF) of the model output. The following is an implementation of PAWN in MATLAB and a reproduction of the figures in the paper. 

The code and a working example are available here <https://github.com/sriki18/pawn>. Below is the figure generated by the example in the repo, which resembles Fig. 4 in [^1]:
