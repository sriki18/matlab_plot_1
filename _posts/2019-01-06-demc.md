# Introduction

The Differential Evolution - Markov Chain[^1] is an optimization algorithm for real parameter spaces. It provides posterior distribution samples of the parameters, rather than point estimates. This helps quantify the uncertainty in that parameter.

The Differential Evolution[^2] component of the algorithm is used to generate candidate solutions, which are either accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis ratio. Since candidate solutions are generated by this method, the proposal or jumping distribution does not have to be tuned. Practically, this translates to the algorithm producing good posterior on difficult optimization problems and avoiding local minima.

Like Differential Evolution, a *population* of solutions is evolved to constitute the Markov Chain. Again, this presents a great practical advantage because model evaluation can be parallelized. This saves a lot of time when the most expensive step is evaluating the model.

I used this algorithm to estimate the parameters of my model[^3] that tracks the flow of viruses from water used to irrigate plants to the final produce. Human viruses, if present in the irrigation water, can internalize into the plant tissue and potentially cause infections in the people who eat such produce.

# Commented MATLAB code

The commented MATLAB code implementing this algorithm can be downloaded from the Github associated with my viral transport model [here](https://github.com/JiangLabUCI/ViralTransport/blob/master/functions/DE_MC.m).

# Example usage

To demonstrate the syntax and usage of the function, here is a minimal example. Suppose we have some data that we know is normally distributed. The mean (&#956; or `mu`) and standard deviation (&#963; or `sigma`)  are unknown and to be estimated by DE-MC. The following snippet sets up this problem and calls the DE-MC function.

~~~matlab
% Generate normally distributed data
mu_real = 4; sig_real = 1;
data = randn(5000,1)*sig_real + mu_real;

% Define the inputs for DE-MC
maxGen = 1000;
Npop = 6;
d = 2;
lb = [-15,0]; ub = [15,15];
genlist = 1:maxGen;
reset = 2;
x2.data = data;

solset = DE_MC(@example_objective,d,lb,ub,maxGen,Npop,x2,reset);
~~~

## Model Diagnostics

The first step to diagnosing the model output is visualizing the objective function. This is easily done with the following snippet:

~~~matlab
plot(solset.Flist, 'linewidth', 2);
xlabel('Generations'); ylabel('Objective value');
set(gca, 'linewidth', 2, 'fontsize', 14);
~~~

The different colors represent the different chains which were run in parallel. Eyeballing the plot suggests convergence, but I sometimes like to look at the log of the objective functions or the post warm-up (or burn-in) period:

~~~matlab
set(gcf, 'Position', [100, 100, 900, 400])
subplot(121)
plot(log10(solset.Flist), 'linewidth', 2);
xlabel('Generations'); ylabel('Log_{10}(Objective value)');
set(gca, 'linewidth', 2, 'fontsize', 14);

subplot(122)
plot(maxGen/2:maxGen, solset.Flist(maxGen/2:end,:), 'linewidth', 2);
xlabel('Generations'); ylabel('Objective value');
set(gca, 'linewidth', 2, 'fontsize', 14);
~~~

We do not see any outlier chains in the log objective plot (left). Also there is good mixing in the objective plot after the warm-up period, suggesting convergence to the optimum. One can also look at the mixing of the parameters with:

~~~matlab
lw = 1.5;
set(gcf, 'Position', [100, 100, 900, 400])
subplot(121)
plot(maxGen/2:maxGen, solset.Xlist(maxGen/2:end,:,1), 'linewidth', lw);
hold on; yline(mu_real, '--', 'linewidth', lw); hold off
xlabel('Generations'); ylabel('\mu');
set(gca, 'linewidth', 2, 'fontsize', 14);
subplot(122)
plot(maxGen/2:maxGen, solset.Xlist(maxGen/2:end,:,2), 'linewidth', lw);
hold on; yline(sig_real, '--', 'linewidth', lw); hold off
xlabel('Generations'); ylabel('\sigma');
set(gca, 'linewidth', 2, 'fontsize', 14);
~~~

![Plot of the sampled posteriors over generations](/assets/DEMC/mixing.png)

Again, we see good mixing without any outlier chains. The original values (`mu_real` and `sig_real`) are given by the dotted lines. Since the chains oscillate around the assumed `mu_real` and `sig_real`, convergence is confirmed. (Note that the oscillations are small as indicated by the Y axis units).

### Note 1

In this example case, it was easy to verify convergence by comparing with `mu_real` and `sigma_real`. Yet, in practice, convergence cannot be confirmed easily, only supported. Some convergence metrics are described [here](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_introbayes_sect008.htm>).

## Obtaining posteriors

The parameter posteriors can be extracted from the chains with the following snippet, taking care to remove the warm-up period as follows:

~~~matlab
X_chains = solset.Xlist(maxGen/2:end,:,:); % Remove warm-up
X_post = nan(size(X_chains,3),size(X_chains,1)*size(X_chains,2));
for ind=1:size(X_chains,3)
    X_post(ind,:) = reshape(X_chains(:,:,ind), 1, size(X_post,2));
end
mu_post = X_post(1,:); sig_post = X_post(2,:);
~~~

These samples can then be used to summarize the inferred parameter or can be plotted:

~~~matlab
fprintf('Predicted mu = %2.2f, sigma = %2.2f \n', mean(mu_post), ...
mean(sig_post));
figure(); h = gca();
s = scatter(mu_post, sig_post, 'o', 'filled', 'SizeData', 20,...
'markeredgecolor', 'none','markerfacecolor', [0.5, 0.15, 0.15]);
xlabel('\mu'); ylabel('\sigma'); hold on;
alpha(s,.125)
ksdensity(h, X_post', 'PlotFcn', 'contour'); hold off;
h2 = findobj(h, 'type', 'contour');
h2.LineColor = 'k'; h2.LineWidth = 1;
set(gca, 'linewidth', 2, 'fontsize', 14)
legend([s, h2], {'Samples', 'Contour'})
~~~

~~~matlab
>> Predicted mu = 4.01, sigma = 1.01
~~~
